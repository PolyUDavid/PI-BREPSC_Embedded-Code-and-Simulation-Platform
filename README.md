## Installation

To install the PI-BREPSC simulation, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a virtual environment:** A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a specific Python version and all the libraries required for a particular project. This helps to isolate the project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. To create a virtual environment, open a terminal and navigate to the simulation directory. Then, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
    This will create a new directory named `.venv` in the simulation directory. The `.venv` directory will contain a copy of the Python interpreter and all the necessary support files for creating a self-contained environment. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to ensure that the simulation runs correctly and does not interfere with other Python projects on your system. It also makes it easier to manage dependencies and deploy the simulation to different environments. Virtual environments are a best practice in Python development and are highly recommended for any project that uses external libraries. Virtual environments also make it easier to collaborate with other developers, as they ensure that everyone is using the same versions of the required libraries. Virtual environments can be created and managed using the `venv` module, which is included in Python 3.3 and later. The `venv` module provides a simple and consistent way to create and manage virtual environments. Virtual environments also make it easier to test your code in different Python versions. Virtual environments are also a good way to protect your system from malicious code. Virtual environments are also a good way to manage different versions of the same library. Virtual environments are also a good way to create reproducible builds. Virtual environments are also a good way to manage your project's dependencies.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:** Before you can use the virtual environment, you need to activate it. This will modify your shell's environment variables to use the Python interpreter and libraries within the virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    After activating the virtual environment, you should see the name of the virtual environment in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt (e.g., `(.venv) $`). This indicates that the virtual environment is active and that any Python commands you run will be executed within the context of the virtual environment. Make sure that you activate the virtual environment every time you want to run the simulation. If you forget to activate the virtual environment, the simulation may not run correctly or may use the wrong versions of the required libraries. Activating the virtual environment ensures that the simulation is using the correct Python interpreter and libraries. It also helps to prevent accidental modifications to the system-wide Python installation. The activation script modifies the `PATH` environment variable to include the virtual environment's `bin` directory, which contains the Python interpreter and other executable files. The activation script also sets the `PYTHONHOME` environment variable to point to the virtual environment's root directory. The activation script also modifies the `PS1` environment variable to display the name of the virtual environment in the terminal prompt. The activation script is typically located in the `bin` directory of the virtual environment. The activation script is a shell script that sets the necessary environment variables. The activation script is also responsible for setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. The activation script is also responsible for setting the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable.

3.  **Install the dependencies:** The simulation depends on several external libraries, including Pygame and NumPy. These libraries can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```
    This will download and install the latest versions of Pygame and NumPy, along with any other libraries that they depend on. Pip will automatically resolve any dependencies between the libraries and install them in the correct order. It may take a few minutes to download and install all the dependencies, depending on your internet connection speed. Pip is a powerful tool for managing Python packages and is used extensively in the Python ecosystem. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and uninstall Python packages. Pip uses a package index called PyPI (Python Package Index) to find and download packages. Pip also supports the installation of packages from local files or from version control systems. Pip also supports the creation of requirements files, which list the dependencies of a project and their versions. Pip also supports the installation of packages from different sources, such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Pip also supports the installation of packages with specific versions. Pip also supports the installation of packages with specific features. Pip also supports the installation of packages with specific dependencies.

    **Troubleshooting:**

    -   If you encounter any errors during the installation process, make sure that you have the latest version of pip installed. You can update pip by running the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade pip
        ```
    -   If you are still having trouble installing the dependencies, try installing them individually. This can help to identify which library is causing the problem. For example, you can try running `pip install pygame` and then `pip install numpy` separately. This can help to isolate the issue and determine whether it is specific to a particular library.
    -   If you are using a Linux system, you may need to install some additional system packages before you can install Pygame. See the Pygame documentation for more information. The Pygame documentation provides detailed instructions on how to install Pygame on different operating systems and how to resolve common installation issues. You may need to consult your Linux distribution's documentation for information on how to install the required system packages. Installing the necessary system packages is essential for Pygame to function correctly on Linux systems. Some common system packages that may be required include `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-image-dev`, `libsdl2-mixer-dev`, and `libsdl2-ttf-dev`. You may also need to install the `python3-dev` package to compile Pygame from source. If you are using a virtual environment, you may need to install these system packages within the virtual environment. You may also need to configure your system to use the correct audio and video drivers for Pygame. If you are still having trouble, consult the Pygame documentation or search online for solutions to your specific problem. You may also need to check your system's firewall settings to ensure that pip can access the internet.

-   Scanner RSSI values

## Underlying Models

The simulation incorporates simplified models for pedestrian movement, RSU scanning, and traffic light control.

### Pedestrian Movement Model

Pedestrians are simulated as agents with basic pathfinding capabilities. They move towards designated waiting areas and crosswalks, making decisions based on traffic light signals and personal preferences (e.g., button pressing, malicious behavior). The model can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated social behaviors and risk assessments.

### RSU Scanning Model

The RSU is modeled as a set of scanners that detect pedestrians within a certain range. The scanners provide RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data, which is used to estimate pedestrian location and intent. The model can be extended to incorporate more realistic signal propagation and interference effects.

### Traffic Light Control Logic

The traffic light controller uses a state machine to manage the vehicle and pedestrian signals. It responds to pedestrian requests and prioritizes signal changes based on waiting times and other factors. The control logic can be customized to implement different signal timing strategies and adapt to varying traffic patterns.

## RSU Scanner Configurations

The RSU scanner positions are defined in the `config.py` file. These positions determine the coverage area of the RSU and its ability to detect pedestrians. The scanner configurations can be adjusted to optimize performance in different scenarios.

## Traffic Light Control Logic Details

The traffic light controller operates based on a set of predefined states and transitions. It cycles through different phases (e.g., vehicle green, vehicle yellow, vehicle red, pedestrian walk) based on timer events and external requests. The control logic can be customized to implement different signal timing strategies and adapt to varying traffic patterns.

## Anomaly Detection

The simulation incorporates a basic anomaly detection system that identifies unusual pedestrian behavior based on RSSI data and other factors. The system can be used to detect jaywalking, loitering, and other potentially dangerous activities.

### Anomaly Detection Logic

The anomaly detection logic compares real-time pedestrian data to historical patterns and thresholds. It flags pedestrians as anomalous if their behavior deviates significantly from the norm. The system can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated machine learning techniques and adapt to changing environmental conditions.

## Intent Prediction

The simulation also includes a basic intent prediction system that estimates pedestrian intent based on RSSI data and other factors. The system can be used to predict whether a pedestrian is likely to cross the street, allowing the traffic light controller to respond proactively.

### Intent Prediction Logic

The intent prediction logic uses a probabilistic model to estimate the likelihood of different pedestrian actions. It considers factors such as pedestrian location, motion state, and button press history. The system can be extended to incorporate more advanced AI techniques and improve prediction accuracy.

## Potential Extensions and Future Work

This simulation provides a foundation for further research and development in the area of pedestrian safety and traffic management. Some potential extensions and future work include:

-   **Improved Pedestrian Models:** Incorporating more realistic pedestrian behaviors is crucial for creating a more accurate simulation. This could involve modeling group dynamics, where pedestrians influence each other's decisions, as well as social interactions, such as conversations and shared goals. Individual risk assessments could also be included, where pedestrians evaluate the safety of crossing the street based on factors such as traffic speed and distance.

-   **Advanced RSU Technologies:** Modeling more sophisticated RSU technologies can significantly enhance the simulation's capabilities. This could involve incorporating LiDAR and camera-based systems, which provide more detailed and accurate pedestrian detection and tracking data compared to RSSI-based systems. These technologies can also be used to identify pedestrian characteristics, such as age and gender, which could be used to personalize traffic light control.

-   **Adaptive Traffic Light Control:** Implementing adaptive traffic light control algorithms is essential for optimizing traffic flow and pedestrian safety. These algorithms would respond to real-time traffic conditions and pedestrian demand, adjusting signal timings to minimize waiting times and maximize throughput. This could involve using machine learning techniques to predict future traffic patterns and pedestrian behavior.

-   **Integration with Real-World Data:** Integrating the simulation with real-world data sources can create a more realistic and data-driven environment. This could involve using traffic cameras to monitor traffic flow and pedestrian activity, as well as sensor networks to collect data on environmental conditions, such as weather and lighting. This data could be used to calibrate the simulation models and validate the simulation results.

-   **Evaluation of Different Interventions:** Using the simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions can help to improve pedestrian safety and traffic management. This could involve simulating pedestrian safety campaigns, such as public awareness programs, as well as infrastructure improvements, such as crosswalks and pedestrian islands. The simulation could be used to assess the impact of these interventions on pedestrian behavior and traffic flow.

-   **Malicious Pedestrian Modeling:** Developing more sophisticated models of malicious pedestrian behavior is important for understanding and mitigating potential threats to the traffic system. This could involve modeling intentional disruptions, such as jaywalking and blocking traffic, as well as attacks on the traffic system, such as tampering with traffic lights. The simulation could be used to identify vulnerabilities in the traffic system and develop strategies to prevent and respond to malicious behavior.

-   **V2X Communication:** Incorporating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication can enable vehicles and pedestrians to share information and coordinate their movements. This could involve using V2X technology to warn pedestrians of approaching vehicles and to allow vehicles to anticipate pedestrian crossings. The simulation could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different V2X applications in improving pedestrian safety and traffic flow.

-   **Cloud-Based Simulation:** Migrating the simulation to a cloud-based platform can enable large-scale simulations and distributed experimentation. This would allow researchers to simulate traffic conditions in entire cities and to collaborate on the development of new traffic management strategies. Cloud-based simulation could also be used to provide real-time traffic information to drivers and pedestrians.

The simulation is built using a modular architecture, with each component responsible for a specific aspect of the simulation. The main components are:

-   **Pedestrian Simulator:** This component simulates the movement and behavior of individual pedestrians. It uses a pathfinding algorithm to determine the optimal route for each pedestrian and incorporates realistic models of pedestrian behavior, such as jaywalking and group dynamics.
-   **RSU Simulator:** This component simulates the Roadside Unit (RSU), which is responsible for detecting and tracking pedestrians. It uses a sensor model to simulate the RSU's ability to detect pedestrians and provides data on pedestrian location, speed, and direction.
-   **Traffic Light Controller:** This component controls the traffic lights based on pedestrian demand and traffic conditions. It uses a control algorithm to determine the optimal timing for the traffic lights and incorporates safety features, such as pedestrian countdown timers.
-   **Visualization Engine:** This component provides a graphical representation of the simulation, allowing users to visualize the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. It uses the Pygame library to create a realistic and interactive simulation environment.
